# Banking Anomaly Detection System

A sophisticated triple-layer fraud detection system that combines business rules, machine learning, and deep learning to protect banking transactions from fraudulent activities.

## Project Overview

This system provides real-time fraud detection using three complementary approaches:
- Rule Engine: Hard business rule enforcement
- Isolation Forest: Statistical anomaly detection  
- Autoencoder: Behavioral pattern analysis

## Key Features

- Triple-Layer Protection: Multiple detection methods working together
- Real-Time Processing: Sub-second transaction analysis
- Web Dashboard: Interactive Streamlit interface
- 41 Intelligent Features: Comprehensive transaction analysis
- Graceful Degradation: System continues if components fail
- Scalable Architecture: Ready for production deployment

## Usage Examples

### Analyze a Transaction
```python
from backend.hybrid_decision import make_decision
from backend.utils import load_model
from backend.autoencoder import AutoencoderInference

# Load models
model, features, scaler = load_model()
autoencoder = AutoencoderInference()

# Analyze transaction
transaction = {
    'transaction_amount': 5000,
    'transfer_type': 'S',  # Overseas
    'hour': 3,             # 3 AM
    'user_avg_amount': 500,
    # ... other features
}

result = make_decision(transaction, user_stats, model, features, autoencoder)
print(f"Fraud Decision: {result['is_fraud']}")
print(f"Reasons: {result['reasons']}")
```

### Web Interface
1. Upload transaction data or enter manually
2. View real-time analysis results
3. See detailed explanations for each decision
4. Monitor system performance metrics

## Detection Methods Explained

### 1. Rule Engine (The Bouncer)
- Enforces hard business limits
- Velocity checks (max 5 txns/10min)
- Dynamic amount thresholds
- Immediate blocking for clear violations

### 2. Isolation Forest (The Detective)
- Uses 100 decision trees
- Isolates statistical outliers
- Learns from 41 transaction features
- Provides anomaly scores

### 3. Autoencoder (The Behavioral Analyst)
- Neural network (41→64→32→14→32→64→41)
- Learns normal behavior patterns
- Detects behavioral deviations
- Reconstruction error analysis

## Feature Engineering

Our system uses 41 intelligent features:

### Transaction Features
- Amount, type, channel, risk scores

### User Behavior
- Historical patterns, deviations, ratios

### Temporal Patterns
- Time of day, day of week, timing analysis

### Velocity Tracking
- Transaction frequency, burst detection

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run property-based tests
python -m pytest tests/test_autoencoder_properties.py

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_frontend_ae.py -v
```

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
```

### Production Deployment
- Docker containerization ready
