## **Data & Features** ### **41 Intelligent Features** The system analyzes transactions using 41 carefully engineered features:

#### **Core Transaction (5 features)** - Transaction amount, transfer type, risk scores, channel information

#### **Temporal Patterns (8 features)** - Hour, day, weekend flags, night transactions, velocity metrics

#### **User Behavior (8 features)** - Historical averages, deviations, spending patterns, risk ratios

#### **Account Relationships (6 features)** - Multiple accounts, beneficiary patterns, geographic anomalies

#### **Velocity Tracking (6 features)** - Transaction counts in 30s/10min/1hour, burst detection

#### **Advanced Analytics (8 features)** - Weekly/monthly spending patterns, statistical measures
